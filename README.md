This project is an exploratory analysis of options for the Town of Franklin's allocation of CPA funds to acquire new open space areas. Three methods are considered for optimization of land aquisition, optimal allocation, largest parcel seletion, and least expensive parcel selection. Four land covers are considered, priority habitats, forest, wetlands, and non-developed areas. Franklin, MA is a municipality in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts 28 miles South of Boston, MA and 26 miles North of Providence, RI. As of the 2020 Annual Report, there was an estimated population of 33,644 individuals. On May 6, 2020 the town council approved the adoption of the Community Preservation Act (CPA) and town members voted in favor of the initiative on November 3, 2021. The Massachusetts Community Preservation Act, was originally signed into state law in 2000, and 187 cities and towns in Massachusetts have adopted CPA. The goal of the CPA was to create a source of funds so communities could retain aspects of their town that fall outside of traditional municipal government jurisdictions. Municipalities contribute to their CPA fund from a surcharge on real property taxes, and the Commonwealth contributes to each municipality's fund
